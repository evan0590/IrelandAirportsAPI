# IrelandAirportsAPI

The application will allow users to retrieve departures and arrivals data from various Irish Airports.

By integrating with the AWS SDK for C++ and using the TreeFrog Framework it will be possible that this project can be set up using only C++, from instantiating server and database instances to running the API.
